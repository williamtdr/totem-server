totem-server
============

This is the websocket server that powers [totem.fm](http://totem.fm). You'll want to have an API for it to point to, please see the [API Repository](http://github.com/williamtdr/totem-api) for setup instructions. You can also see a live configuration of the site at the above link.

When you've configured the database and API, point the server to the right values by copying config.sample.js to config.js and filling in the values for your server.
